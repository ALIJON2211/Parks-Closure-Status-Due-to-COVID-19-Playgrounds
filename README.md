# Problem Description
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, NYC Parks temporarily closed several amenities, including Playgrounds in order to to practice social distancing and slow the spread of COVID-19.The city said that these public areas are extremely difficult to keep sanitized and safe for people to use. There will be signage around those playgrounds and play areas explaining the closure. These will be closed until further notice.I will be using I will using Google Data Studio and Google Chart, in order to visualise the data that provided by Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR).
